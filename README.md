## Project Plan
```
Hereâ€™s a simplified and clear **Project Plan** based on the requirements provided:

---

### **Project Plan: Psychic Ability Test App**

#### **Phase 1: Planning**  
1. **Define Scope**:  
   - Clarify app functionality (psychic test, scoring, retro design).  
   - Confirm technology stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).  

2. **Gather Resources**:  
   - Select a pixel font (e.g., "Press Start 2P" from Google Fonts).  
   - Create a list of words for the test (e.g., 10-15 words).  

---

#### **Phase 2: Development**  

**Task 1: HTML Structure**  
- Create a `div` container for the app interface.  
- Include:  
  - Title and instructions.  
  - Button to start the test.  
  - Input fields and submit button for guesses.  
  - Display area for the test results and "Psychic Score".  
  - Footer link to "Pixel Oracle".  

**Task 2: CSS Styling**  
- Import the pixel font.  
- Apply retro styling:  
  - Monospace, pixelated font.  
  - Simple, boxy layout with contrasting colors.  
- Style buttons, inputs, and the footer link appropriately.  

**Task 3: JavaScript Logic**  
- Define a list of words for the test.  
- Create functions to:  
  - Randomly select 2 hidden words.  
  - Compare user guesses to hidden words.  
  - Calculate and update the "Psychic Score" after 5 rounds.  
  - Reset the test for replayability.  

---

#### **Phase 3: Testing**  
1. **Functionality Testing**:  
   - Verify the test runs correctly for 5 rounds.  
   - Ensure scoring logic works as expected.  
   - Check the footer link opens in a new tab.  

2. **Design Testing**:  
   - Confirm pixel font is applied consistently.  
   - Test responsiveness on different screen sizes.  

3. **Edge Case Testing**:  
   - Handle empty or incorrect user inputs gracefully.  

---

#### **Phase 4: Deployment**  
1. Host the app on a static web server or GitHub Pages.  
2. Test the live app in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).  

---

### **Technical Considerations**  
1. **HTML**:  
   - Use semantic elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) for better structure.  

2. **CSS**:  
   - Ensure the pixel font is supported in all major browsers.  
   - Use `rem` or `em` units for scalable design.  

3. **JavaScript**:  
   - Use `Arrays` for word storage and random selection.  
   - Implement error handling for invalid inputs.  

---

### **Milestones**  
1. **Milestone 1**: Basic HTML and CSS structure completed.  
2. **Milestone 2**: JavaScript logic implemented and functional.  
3. **Milestone 3**: Testing completed and issues resolved.  
4. **Milestone 4**: App deployed and finalized.  

---

### **Timeline**  
- **Week 1**: Planning and HTML/CSS setup.  
- **Week 2**: JavaScript development.  
- **Week 3**: Testing and debugging.  
- **Week 4**: Deployment and final review.
